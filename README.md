# Voice-Controlled-Exoskeleton-with-ML-and-IoT-Integration
Designed a wearable exoskeleton prototype integrating Arduino, servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and Google Assistant + IFTTT voice triggers. Built Python- and Flask-based control systems with preliminary ML modeling for motion prediction. Future development includes gyroscope feedback and cloud-based monitoring.
